# Phonebook – Software Engineering Project

This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering course exam.  
The goal was to build a simple **phonebook application in Java**, following the main stages of the software development lifecycle.

## 📌 Objectives

- Develop an application for managing contacts (add, remove, edit, search).
- Apply object-oriented design principles.
- Document the code and validate its functionality through test cases.

## 🛠️ Development Stages

1. **Requirements elicitation**  
   Analysis of the desired features and definition of expected behaviors.

2. **System design**  
   The project was organized into classes with defined core operations.  
   Technical documentation was also generated using *Doxygen* (configured with the included `Doxyfile`).

3. **Implementation and testing**  
   Implementation of the designed classes and creation of test cases to ensure correct program behavior.

## 📄 Documentation

Full documentation can be generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) with the provided `Doxyfile`:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
